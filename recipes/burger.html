    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A spicy, flavorful, and moist turkey burger. This is my husband's favorite. It tastes delicious and I make it with extra lean ground turkey breast. The grated onion, barbeque sauce, and Worcestershire sauce add moisture as well as flavor to the turkey.</p>

        <li>1 tablespoon prepared horseradish</li>
