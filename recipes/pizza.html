    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Pizza Dough:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 pinch white sugar</li>          
        <li>3 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour</li>            
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>           
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>            
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>            
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Garlic Oil</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Pizza Toppings:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup tomato sauce, divided</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped tomatoes, divided</li>
        <li>¼ cup sliced black olives, divided</li>
        <li>¼ cup roasted red peppers, drained and chopped, divided</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh basil, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Make dough: Pour warm water into a large bowl; dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix in flour, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and salt until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl.</li>
        <li>Turn onto a lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth, about 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place dough in a well-oiled bowl and cover with a damp cloth.</li>
        <li>Set aside to rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch down; knead in garlic and basil. Set aside to rise for 1 more hour, or until doubled again.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make garlic oil: Combine 1/2 cup olive oil with minced garlic in a microwave-safe cup or bowl. Heat for 30 seconds in the microwave.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat; brush the grate with garlic oil.</li>
        <li>Make pizzas: Punch down dough and divide in half. Form each half into an oblong shape 3/8 to 1/2 inch thick.</li>
        <li>Carefully place one piece of dough on the hot grill. Dough will begin to puff almost immediately. When the bottom crust has lightly browned, turn dough over using two spatulas.</li>
        <li>Working quickly, brush garlic oil over crust.</li>
        <li>Top with 1/2 of each of the following: tomato sauce, chopped tomatoes, olives, red peppers, cheese, and basil.</li>
        <li>Close the lid and cook until cheese melts. Remove from grill and set aside to cool for a few minutes. Repeat with second piece of dough.</li>
    </ol>
